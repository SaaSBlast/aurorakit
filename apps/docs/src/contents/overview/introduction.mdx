`Shadow Panda` is an adoption of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), tailored specifically for developers utilizing [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) as an alternative to Tailwind CSS.

> This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.  
> _Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

## Acknowledgement

A huge thanks to the creators of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for providing an excellent set of components and documentation.  
Most of the components and documentation were taken from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Also, we couldn't have done it without the help of:

- [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/)
- [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/)
