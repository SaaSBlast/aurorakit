# Introduction

<div className={cx(lead(), css({ display: 'block', mt: '2' }))}>
  <span>Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Panda CSS.</span>
</div>

`Shadow Panda` is an adoption of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), tailored specifically for developers utilizing [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) as an alternative to Tailwind CSS.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._
