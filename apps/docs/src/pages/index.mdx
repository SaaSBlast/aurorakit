# Shadow Panda

`Shadow Panda` is an adoption of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), tailored specifically for developers utilizing [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) as an alternative to Tailwind CSS.

We provide a **preset** for [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) that allows you to use the same components as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), but with [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/).
